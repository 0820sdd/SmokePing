* TOP10
  - show a list of the top 10 (most whatever graphs)
    gmourani@privalodc.com

* UPTIME
  - define update via snmp pointer per device
  - possibility to call an external script
    -> generic uptime plugin?

* ATTENTION
  allow to define a thereshold rule by looking at
  two average medians and take action when threshold triped

* ALIASES
  allow to have atarget which points to a different target
  only targets with host are considered

* ALERTS
  only send alerts when the state changes
  - suggested by Marc Haber,
    <http://lists.ee.ethz.ch/smokeping-users/msg01439.html>
  make 'active alerts' (whatever that means, have to think
  this through) visible (eg. different colour) in the CGI menu
  - suggested by Cornel Badea <cornel *sbhost.ro>

* DAEMON
  reread config periodically or with SIGHUP so that
  no measurement is interrupted
  - suggested by Taisuke Yamada,
    <http://lists.ee.ethz.ch/smokeping-users/msg01445.html>
  - concurrent probe processes need a signal anyway,
    they have to exit and new ones started so that
    we don't have to compare to the old config

* REMOTE EXECUTION
  generic remote probe
  - a possibility for basefork-derived probes to reuse the same
    SSH connection with shell for() loops for all the pings to a given
    target

* GENERIC EXEC PROBE
  - almost every probe has a different way of calling system(), exec()
    or similar. This should be in an inheritable module.
  - the module should also support extra commandline arguments 

* RRD 
  configurable RRD parameters per target?
  - suggested by Leos Bitto,
