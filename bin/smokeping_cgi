=head1 NAME

smokeping_cgi - SmokePing webfrontend

=head1 OVERVIEW

This script acts as a 'website' for your SmokePing monitoring operation. It
presents the targets you are looking at in a tree structure and draws graphs
as they are required by people looking at the pages.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

To get B<smokeping.cgi> going, you need a webserver which allows you to run
CGI or better FastCGI scripts. The system must be setup so that the cgi
process is allowed to write to the image caching area as defined in the
config file.

This script runs fine as a normal CGI, B<BUT> it will appear to be very slow,
because it does a lot of things when starting up. So if the script has to be
started a fresh on every click, this is both slow and a tough thing for your
webserver. I therefore strongly recommend using FastCGI.

Please refer to the installation document for detailed setup instructions.

=head1 SETUP

When installing SmokePing, I recomend to place a little shell wrapper
into your htdocs directory, to launch the actual smokeping.cgi process:

 #!/bin/sh
 # maybe add some extra perl search path
 # export PERL5LIB=/opt/rrdtool/lib/perl
 exec /opt/smokeping/bin/smokeping.cgi /opt/smokeping/etc/config
